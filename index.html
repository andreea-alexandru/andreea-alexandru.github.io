		<!--<h2 class="w3-text-black">PhD</h2> -->

 <p>
    I am a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, College Park, within the Department of Computer Science, working with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/" target="_blank">Jonathan Katz</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  My research interests are in the areas of (i) privacy-preserving protocols with applications in cyber-physical systems and machine learning, (ii) multi-party computation and distributed algorithms.
 </p>   
 <br>

  <h3 class="w3-text-black">Previous Education</h4>
 <p></p>
 <p>
    I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in May 2021 under the supervision of professor <a href="https://www.georgejpappas.org/" target="_blank">George J. Pappas</a> (UPenn). In my first year, I was also co-advised by professor <a href="https://jadbabaie.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Ali Jadbabaie</a> (MIT). My thesis committee members were <a href="https://old.control.ee.ethz.ch/info/people/morari/" target="_blank">Manfred Morari</a> (ETHZ and UPenn), <a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/tal-rabin/" target="_blank">Tal Rabin</a> (Algorand and UPenn), and <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/" target="_blank">Sebastian Angel</a> (UPenn).

 </p>

  <p> I have received my B.Eng. in Systems Engineering from University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, where I was valedictorian.
